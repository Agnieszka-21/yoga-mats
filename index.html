            <div id="intro">
                <p>Wherever you practice, a proper yoga mat is essential. Working on a rug, slippery towel or overly-soft gym cushion can
                lead to injury and frustration. Most studios and gyms offer mats for public use, but owning your own can be a more
                hygienic alternative.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While there are many options available, the vast majority of yoga mats work perfectly well for any style of yoga. Often,
                your choice will come down to personal preference. That said, understanding the differences will help you select a mat
                that fits your personal needs.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div id="thickness">
                <div>
                    <h2>Yoga Mat Thickness and Weight</h2>
                    <p>Yoga mats range from super thin and compact travel styles that weigh a mere 2 lbs. to cushy quarter-inch beasts that
                    weigh up to 7 lbs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you’re not sure where to start, choose a mat that’s about 1/8-in. thick (or 3.175 mm), a pretty standard thickness.
                    These mats are excellent for those in a strong, flowing practice. They allow solid contact with the floor, which helps
                    with stability during a variety of poses. Compared to thicker mats, they are also less likely to catch and get in your
                    way when you flow from pose to pose.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="thinner">
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Thinner mats </span>
                        <span>can help increase stability for styles of yoga with more active poses or balanced, focused poses. Look for mats with
                        textured surfaces to maintain better grip when the poses get more strenuous.</span>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="thicker">
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Thicker mats </span>
                        <span>provide extra cushioning and are best for more therapeutic practices. If you enjoy restorative yoga, a style with fewer
                        poses that you hold longer, for example, you may prefer a softer, more cushioned mat. Thicker mats are also more
                        comfortable for forearm and kneeling poses and for yogis with tender knees or achy joints. But they can be more
                        difficult to balance on during standing poses.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Travel mats </span>
                        <span>are specifically designed for portability. Travel mats are very thin and light and pack down smaller than traditional
                        mats, so they’re easy to take along in your luggage. Keep in mind that you will sacrifice some cushioning with a travel
                        mat.</span>

                    <h2>Yoga Mat Materials and Durability</h2>
                    <p>When selecting the material for your yoga mat, you can choose anything from inexpensive PVC to environmentally friendly
                    natural rubber. Which material you choose will affect the mat’s price, weight, grip and durability. Generally, thicker
                    mats last longer than thinner mats. That said, mat durability is also related to the material the mat is made from.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="pvc">
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">PVC </span>
                        <span>is a plastic-based material that is highly durable, easy to clean and offers excellent floor grip. However, PVC mats are
                        non-absorbent and can become slippery when you sweat heavily. PVC is latex-free, a benefit to those with latex
                        allergies, however, it is not biodegradable or as environmentally friendly as other options.</span>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="tpe">
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">TPE (thermoplastic elastomer) </span>
                        <span>is a man-made blend, usually of plastic and rubber polymers. TPE mats may be more environmentally friendly than PVC, and
                        some are fully recyclable. TPE mats are generally less durable than PVC mats of the same thickness, but still deliver
                        good traction.</span>

                <div id="eco-mats">
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Eco / natural mats </span>
                        <span>come from a variety of sources, including natural rubber, organic cotton, and jute. Compared to other options, eco mats
                        are slightly less grippy on the floor, but their natural texture provides traction for your body. Eco mats lack the
                        decade-long durability of PVC, yet they top the list if sustainability is your priority.</span>

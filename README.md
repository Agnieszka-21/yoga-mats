# Yoga Mats

![Responsive mockup]()

### Introduction

Yoga Mats is a site that educates yoga aficionados about different types of yoga mats available on the market and helps them choose a mat that best suits their needs so that they stay motivated and enjoy their practice. It will be useful for both beginners and seasoned practitioners, taking into account their practical requirements, the style of yoga they practice, and other common factors that influence the type of mat they need.

## Table of Contents

## User Experience

### User Stories

  - __External User's Goals__

    - The user wants to learn about different types of yoga mats available on the market, understand key differences, and be empowered to make an informed decision regarding a purchase.
    - The user is looking for guidance regarding which type of mat suits their specific needs, factoring in the style of yoga they practise and practicalities regarding location of their practice (at home, at a studio, while travelling).

  - __Site Owner's Goals__

    - The goal of the site is to be the primary source of information regarding types of yoga mats in order to educate yoga practicioners and empower them to make the best decision when purchasing a mat. 
    - The site aims to reach any yoga practicioners, regardless of their experience or level. It compares different yoga mat types, showing the differences through text, visuals (table), as well as a video tutorial. This way the information is accessible and easily digestible for anyone interested in the topic, be it a beginner or a seasoned yogi.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

Purple (#4A1861), often associated with yoga and widely known as a popular color of the first yoga mats, is the main color of the site. It is used for the Logo, any navigational Font Awesome icons (the menu icon for mobile devices as well as social media icons in the footer), any headings, as box-shadow color for the header/nav bar, and also for the centrepiece icons and hyperlink text on pages Thank You and 404. It corresponds well with the hero image, which shows mats in multiple colours, purple being one of them. 

A very light shade of purple (#FCF2FF, in the style.css file used in its rgba version) is used as a background color for cover text in the hero section of the homepage, for the contact form, and also for the  pages Thank You and 404, which are designed in a more minimalistic style.

White (#FFFFFF) is used as clean, simple background color on the homepage and the Choose your mat page, as well as in the header and footer of all 5 pages, providing high contrast for any text and images.

A shade of black (#101C24) is used for any regular and bold text in the main part of each page, as well as in the navigation bar, providing excellent contrast with a white or light purple background. 

Since the background image on the Contact us page introduces a bold yellow-green colour (#B4B535), the same colour is also used in the form, when hovering over the input fields and the "send" button on laptops and larger screens.

![Contrast Grid]()

The table on the Choose your mat page uses green, red, and yellow emoji icons to depict how suitable each mat type is in a simple and widely-understandable way for those who prefer visual materials. A pastel shade of each of these colours ensures that the icons do not take the user's attention away from the main colour scheme of the site. Since the colours themselves have a very clear meaning, contrast is in this case not as important as it is with any text elements. 

### Typography

Two font families are imported from Google fonts and used across all pages:

- __Libre Franklin, weight 300__  
A sans-serif font, Libre Franklin is used for the Logo (h1) and any headings (h2, h3). The headings on pages Home and Choose your mat are uppercase to provide more variety since these pages are rich in text content. The headings on pages with significantly less text (Contact, Thank you, and 404) are lowercase to convey simplicity and accessibility, communicating an informal and inviting character of the site.
- __Schibsted Grotesk, weight 400 and 700__
Also a sans-serif font, Schibsted Grotesk is used for any regular and bold text that is not a heading. It is easily legible and complements Libre Franklin, conveying the same values of simplicity and accessibility. 

### Imagery
All images depict colourful yoga mats, either rolled up or being used for a yoga practice, making it easy for the user to understand the subject of the site at a glance. 

## Features

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea...

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Lighthouse

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing
You can test your site for accessibility through the wave.webaim site - it needs to be deployed in order for it to test it. Fix any errors that it gives

### Manual Testing
You need to perform, and document everything you did to manually test your site.
At a minimum - you need to check every link on every page works as intended.
So that is check every link in the nav bar (do this on every single page because its a link in a different file) and any other links that appear on your site.
Test the responsiveness of the site - you can do this in the dev tools in responsive mode.
You should also load the site once deployed on as many devices you have access to. What is different from one device to the next? why is it different?

Test the user stories that you created earlier in the readme - did you satisfy the goal, how?

To write up the tests you can use a table,
| Feature being tested | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Actual Outcome | Result (Pass or fail) |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here |

You should have tests for every section of every page.. individually.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Technologies Used

Detail what technologies you used. So what code languages, what frameworks, libraries, what software did you use to develop the site - Balsamic for your wireframes, Figma for a mockup?

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy were as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
- Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

The live link can be found here - <https://agnieszka-21.github.io/yoga-mats/index.html>

(Detail how to clone the repository, how to fork the repository - how to run the site locally and how to deploy it.)

# Yoga Mats

![Responsive mockup]()

## Introduction

Yoga Mats is a site that educates yoga aficionados about different types of yoga mats available on the market and helps them choose a mat that best suits their needs so that they stay motivated and enjoy their practice. It will be useful for both beginners and seasoned practitioners, taking into account their practical requirements, the style of yoga they practice, and other common factors that influence the type of mat they need.


## Table of Contents


## User Experience

### User Stories

  - __External User's Goals__

    - The user wants to learn about different types of yoga mats available on the market, understand key differences, and be empowered to make an informed decision regarding a purchase.
    - The user is looking for guidance regarding which type of mat suits their specific needs, factoring in the style of yoga they practise and practicalities regarding location of their practice (at home, at a studio, while travelling).

  - __Site Owner's Goals__

    - The goal of the site is to be the primary source of information regarding types of yoga mats in order to educate yoga practicioners and empower them to make the best decision when purchasing a mat. 
    - The site aims to reach any yoga practicioners, regardless of their experience or level. It compares different yoga mat types, showing the differences through text, visuals (table), as well as a video tutorial. This way the information is accessible and easily digestible for anyone interested in the topic, be it a beginner or a seasoned yogi.


## Design

### Colour Scheme

- __Purple__ 
Purple (#4A1861), often associated with yoga and widely known as a popular color of the first yoga mats, is the main color of the site. It is used for the Logo, any navigational Font Awesome icons (the menu icon for mobile devices as well as social media icons in the footer), any headings, as box-shadow color for the header/nav bar, and also for the centrepiece icons and hyperlink text on pages Thank You and 404. It corresponds well with the hero image, which shows mats in multiple colours, purple being one of them. 

- __Light Purple__ 
A very light shade of purple (#FCF2FF, in the style.css file used in its rgba version) is used as a background color for cover text in the hero section of the homepage, for the contact form, and also for the  pages Thank You and 404, which are designed in a more minimalistic style.

- __White__ 
White (#FFFFFF) is used as clean, simple background color on the homepage and the Choose your mat page, as well as in the header and footer of all 5 pages, providing high contrast for any text and images.

- __Black__ 
A shade of black (#101C24) is used for any regular and bold text in the main part of each page, as well as in the navigation bar, providing excellent contrast with a white or light purple background. 

- __Chartreuse__ 
Since the background image on the Contact us page introduces a bold chartreuse colour (#B4B535), the same colour is also used in the form, when hovering over the input fields and the "send" button on laptops and larger screens.

![Contrast Grid]()

- __Green, yellow, and red (table)__ 
The table on the Choose your mat page uses green, red, and yellow emoji icons to depict how suitable each mat type is in a simple and widely-understandable way for those who prefer visual materials. A slightly pastel shade of each of these colours ensures that the icons do not take the user's attention away from the main colour scheme of the site. Since the colours themselves have a very clear symbolic meaning, contrast is in this case not as important as it is with any text elements. 

### Typography

Two font families are imported from Google fonts and used across all pages:

- __Libre Franklin, weight 300__  
A sans-serif font, Libre Franklin is used for the Logo (h1) and any headings (h2, h3). The headings on pages Home and Choose your mat are uppercase to provide more variety since these pages are rich in text content. The headings on pages with significantly less text (Contact, Thank you, and 404) are lowercase to convey simplicity and accessibility, communicating an informal and inviting character of the site.
- __Schibsted Grotesk, weight 400 and 700__
Also a sans-serif font, Schibsted Grotesk is used for any regular and bold text that is not a heading. It is easily legible and complements Libre Franklin, conveying the same values of simplicity and accessibility. 

### Imagery
All images depict colourful yoga mats, either rolled up or being used for a yoga practice, making it easy for the user to understand the subject of the site at a glance.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

The embedded YouTube video on mobile phones works well in the regular view but in the rotated view it is too large to be fully shown on the screen in its entirety without scrolling down/up. The bug has not been fixed since it is unlikely to impair the user experience in a significant way - the user can always switch back to the regular view, or choose to open the video directly on YouTube instead so the feature still works as intended.
